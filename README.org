* Python-NetworkScanner.py


Store all the data in a dictionary

Scans the local network and prints the IP, Mac Address, Vendor, and Open Ports
to stdout. The data is comma delimited, just like a CSV.

I tested this on Windows 11 using Python 3.11. I didn't test this on Linux.

* Installation
On the releases page there's a prebuilt windows executable. I advise you create
your own binary with PyInstaller unless your lazy and trust me

#+begin_src
pip install -r requirements.txt
python3 Python-NetworkScasnner.py
#+end_src

* Usage

*Administrative rights is /probably/ required for the pings to work*

#+begin_src
# Optionally use -t to specify how many concurrent threads should run.
# Default value is 1000
Python-NetworkScanner.py -r 192.168.0.5
#+end_src
