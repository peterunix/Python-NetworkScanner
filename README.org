* Python-NetworkScanner.py
Another CLI tool for local network port scanning! This will find all online hosts on the
local network and then print the IP, mac address, vendor, and open ports to
STDOUT. The data is comma delimited, just like a CSV.


* Installation
A prebuilt windows binary can be found on the releases page. I advise you create
your own binary with PyInstaller unless your lazy and trust me

#+begin_src
pip install -r requirements.txt
python3 Python-NetworkScanner.py
#+end_src

* Usage

*Administrative rights is /probably/ required for the pings to work*

#+begin_src
# Optionally use -t to specify how many concurrent threads should run.
# Default value is 1000
Python-NetworkScanner.py -r 192.168.0.0/24
#+end_src

* Note
If ICMP is blocked by the devices firewall it will not show up in the output.
